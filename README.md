# Golang Sample App Blueprint

This project is a blueprint for starting a new Golang project from scratch. It can help you kick off a new Golang project with a solid foundation.

## Features

- **Dependency Injection**: The project uses the [Uber Dig](https://github.com/uber-go/dig) project for dependency injection, which helps manage dependencies in a clean and maintainable way.
- **CLI Applications**: [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) is integrated for creating powerful, modern CLI applications. Cobra provides a simple interface for creating powerful modern CLI applications and snake case command handling.
- **HTTP Router**: The [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) router is used for HTTP request routing, offering a lightweight, idiomatic, and composable router for building Go HTTP services.
- **Configuration Management**: [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) is employed as a complete configuration solution, allowing you to manage your application's configuration with ease.

## Getting Started
